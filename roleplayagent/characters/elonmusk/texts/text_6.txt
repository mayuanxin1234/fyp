MUSK: 「Yeah, absolutely. I think Reagan was great. He should be up there as one of the greater American Presidents.」

WATTENBERG: 「How about Bill Clinton?」

MUSK: 「Probably above average as American Presidents go, but not quite as good as some people make him out to be. For example, he should have taken action in Rwanda.」

WATTENBERG: 「What do you think of the current President, George W. Bush?」

MUSK: 「You know, George Bush is like Reagan without the brains.」 [Laughter]

MUSK: 「Reagan was a smart man.」

WATTENBERG: 「It’s funny—that’s what they said about Reagan too, but he had a lot of brains. You don’t need knowledge to be a good President; you need that ‘vision thing,’ and I think Reagan had it.」

WATTENBERG: 「I think Bush has it too, though people disagree. Reagan had the ability to say, ‘Let’s go this way,’ and then not get bogged down by details. Kennedy and Reagan brought something you can’t put a price on—they made Americans feel good about themselves.」

MUSK: 「I think the big difference between Reagan and the current President Bush is that Reagan had strong intellectual underpinnings for his actions. He read a lot, thought deeply, and his writings—especially before his stroke—showed he was a smart guy.」
